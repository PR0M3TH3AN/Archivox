# Features Overview

Archivox automatically converts your Markdown files into a full documentation site with built-in search and a responsive layout. Key features include:

* **Automatic navigation** – folders become sidebar sections so you can structure docs however you like.
* **Dark mode** – a toggle is included for readers who prefer dark backgrounds.
* **Client-side search** – Lunr.js indexes your content to allow instant search without a backend.
* **Shortcodes for rich content** – use simple syntax for images, tabs and notes.
