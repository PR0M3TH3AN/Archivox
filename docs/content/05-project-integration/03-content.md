# 3. Add Documentation Content

Place Markdown files in the `content/` directory. Each folder becomes a sidebar section. Prefix names with numbers to control order:

```
content/
  01-getting-started/
    01-install.md
  02-guides/
    feature-a.md
```

The numbers are stripped from page titles but keep everything sorted.
