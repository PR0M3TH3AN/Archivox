# 2. Understand `config.yaml`

The generated `config.yaml` contains basic site information. Adjust the values to match your project:

```yaml
site:
  title: "My Project Docs"
  description: "Documentation for the project"
navigation:
  search: true
```

Change the title and description to what you want displayed in the sidebar and `<head>` tags.
