# DocForge Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **DocForge**, a lightweight static site generator designed for "Read&nbsp;the&nbsp;Docs" style websites.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev # start local server at http://localhost:8080
npm run build # generate the _site/ folder
```

DocForge converts Markdown files inside a `content/` folder into a full documentation site with search, navigation, and responsive design.

Check the **Getting Started** section to learn how to install and run DocForge locally.
